### ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a web developer full of interest in learning both sides of the web.

The Front-end seems fascinating to me, simply the effect of being able to visually demonstrate the information seems wonderful to me, besides I see the front-end as fundamental to create a more accessible web.

The back-end seems wonderful to me, since I can't imagine something as rewarding as being able to implement good development techniques that allow the development of business ideas.
